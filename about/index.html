        <br>
		<p>RedFox is a community of passionate gamers who share a love for playing games. Our team of dedicated professionals is committed to delivering the best possible gaming experience to our users.</p>
        <br>
        <p>RedFox was born in 2023, founded by a player named Pilot2254, who is an avid gamer himself. He enjoys playing games such as Valorant, CS:GO, and many more. One day, he realized that there were players in professional teams such as SEN TenZ in Time Sentinels, and he felt inspired to create his own team too. It was during a shower that he came up with the name RedFox, and the rest is history.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pilot2254 started creating the TRF Discord server and this website to bring together gamers from around the world. He owes a big thanks to his dad for buying this domain name. With the website and server set up, Pilot2254 began to collect users through various channels such as YouTube videos, social media sites, and word-of-mouth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At RedFox, we believe that gaming is more than just a hobby. It's a way of life, and we're committed to providing our users with the best possible gaming experience. That's why we've created a platform that offers a diverse range of games to cater to different interests and skill levels.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then he start collecting users with YouTube videos, and on more social sites, because it's the only way to collect people.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We also have a hidden tip generator on our website that offers users tips and tricks to improve their gaming skills. We're constantly looking for ways to improve and enhance our users' experience, and we're always open to feedback.</p>
